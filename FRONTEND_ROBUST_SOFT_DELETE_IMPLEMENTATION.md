# Frontend Implementation - Robust Soft Delete for Doctors

## Overview

This document describes the frontend implementation of the robust soft delete functionality for the Doctor Service. The implementation covers all 3 scenarios as requested and provides a comprehensive UI for managing doctor activation and deactivation across branches.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Doctor Service (doctorService.js)

- **New API Methods**: Added 9 new methods to handle robust soft delete operations
- **Branch-Specific Operations**: Support for branch-specific activation/deactivation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing methods maintained for legacy support

#### New Methods Added:

- `getDoctorBranchStatus(doctorId, branchId)` - Get doctor status for specific branch
- `isDoctorAvailableInBranch(doctorId, branchId)` - Check availability in branch
- `getDoctorActiveBranches(doctorId)` - Get all active branches for doctor
- `deactivateDoctorFromBranches(doctorId, branchIds, forceGlobalDeactivation)` - Scenarios 1 & 2
- `activateDoctorInBranch(doctorId, branchId)` - Scenario 3
- `getDoctorsWithBranchStatus(branchId, params)` - Get doctors with branch filtering
- `bulkDeactivateDoctorsFromBranches(operations)` - Bulk operations
- `getDoctorDetailedStatus(doctorId)` - Comprehensive status information

### 2. Custom Hooks (useDoctorRobustSoftDelete.js)

- **React Query Integration**: Optimistic updates and cache invalidation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with user feedback
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for all operations

#### Hooks Created:

- `useDeactivateDoctorFromBranches()` - Handle deactivation mutations
- `useActivateDoctorInBranch()` - Handle activation mutations
- `useGetDoctorsWithBranchStatus()` - Fetch doctors with branch status
- `useGetDoctorBranchStatus()` - Get specific branch status
- `useGetDoctorActiveBranches()` - Get active branches
- `useBulkDeactivateDoctorsFromBranches()` - Bulk operations

### 3. UI Components

#### RobustDeleteModal Component

- **Scenario Detection**: Automatically detects which scenario applies
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of action consequences
- **Branch Selection**: Multi-select with current branch pre-selected
- **Force Global Option**: Available for Scenario 2a
- **Smart Validation**: Prevents invalid operations

#### Enhanced DoctorsList Component

- **Status Indicators**: Visual badges showing doctor status (Active/Inactive)
- **Conditional Buttons**:
  - Inactive doctors → Show "Activate" button (green)
  - Active doctors → Show "Deactivate" button (red)
- **Branch-Aware Filtering**: Shows both active and inactive doctors based on selected branch
- **Enhanced Branch Display**: Shows status for each branch when viewing "All"

#### Custom UI Components Created:

- `Modal` - Reusable modal component
- `Checkbox` - Custom checkbox with proper styling
- `Alert` - Alert component with variants
- `Toast` - Simple notification system

## Three Scenarios Coverage

### Scenario 1: Single Branch Doctor

- **UI Behavior**: Shows warning that both branch and global status will be deactivated
- **Button Text**: "Deactivate from 1 Branch"
- **No Options**: Force global checkbox disabled (not applicable)

### Scenario 2a: Multi-Branch Partial Deactivation

- **UI Behavior**: Shows information that doctor remains globally active
- **Force Global Option**: Checkbox available to override default behavior
- **Branch Selection**: Multi-select with current branch pre-selected

### Scenario 2b: Multi-Branch Full Deactivation

- **UI Behavior**: When all branches selected, shows warning of global deactivation
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects when all branches are selected
- **No Force Option**: Force global checkbox disabled (not needed)

### Scenario 3: Reactivation

- **UI Behavior**: Simple confirmation modal for activation
- **Button**: Green "Activate" button for inactive doctors
- **Branch-Specific**: Only activates in the currently selected branch

## Branch-Based Filtering

### When Branch is Selected:

- Fetches doctors using `getDoctorsWithBranchStatus(branchId)`
- Shows both active and inactive doctors for that branch
- Conditional buttons based on doctor status in that specific branch

### When "All" is Selected:

- Fetches all doctors using standard API
- Shows global doctor status
- Displays branch information with individual status badges

## User Experience Enhancements

### Visual Feedback:

- **Status Badges**: Green for active, red for inactive
- **Card Styling**: Color-coded borders and backgrounds
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during operations
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages for user feedback

### Accessibility:

- **Clear Labels**: Descriptive button text and labels
- **Color Contrast**: Proper contrast ratios for status indicators
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and proper semantic markup

## Error Handling

### Network Errors:

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation

### Validation Errors:

- Client-side validation before API calls
- Clear error messages with actionable feedback
- Prevention of invalid operations

### Edge Cases:

- Handle doctors with no branches
- Handle permission-based restrictions
- Handle concurrent modifications

## Testing Implementation

### Unit Tests Created:

- Component rendering tests
- Status badge logic tests
- Search functionality tests
- Button behavior tests

### Integration Test Scenarios:

- All three deletion scenarios
- Activation workflow
- Branch filtering behavior
- Error handling paths

## Performance Optimizations

### React Query Features:

- **Caching**: Intelligent caching with automatic invalidation
- **Background Updates**: Keep data fresh without blocking UI
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback before server confirmation

### Client-Side Optimizations:

- **Memoization**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Lazy Loading**: Modal components loaded on demand
- **Debounced Search**: Prevent excessive API calls during search

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers:

1. **Import the enhanced service**:

   ```javascript
   import { doctorService } from "../services/doctorService.js";
   ```

2. **Use the new hooks**:

   ```javascript
   import {
     useDeactivateDoctorFromBranches,
     useActivateDoctorInBranch,
   } from "../hooks/useDoctorRobustSoftDelete.js";
   ```

3. **Add toast provider to app**:
   ```javascript
   import { ToastProvider } from "./components/ui/toast.jsx";
   ```

### For Users:

1. **Viewing Doctors**:

   - Select a branch to see branch-specific doctor status
   - Select "All" to see global doctor status with branch breakdown

2. **Deactivating Doctors**:

   - Click red "Deactivate" button on active doctors
   - Review the scenario information in the modal
   - Select additional branches if needed (multi-branch doctors)
   - Choose force global deactivation if required
   - Confirm the operation

3. **Activating Doctors**:
   - Click green "Activate" button on inactive doctors
   - Confirm activation in the current branch
   - Doctor becomes active in selected branch

## API Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility:

- All existing API calls continue to work
- Legacy delete functionality preserved
- Gradual migration path available

### New API Integration:

- RESTful endpoints following existing patterns
- Consistent error response format
- Proper HTTP status codes

## Security Considerations

### Authorization:

- Branch-based access control respected
- User permissions validated on backend
- Sensitive operations require confirmation

### Data Validation:

- Input sanitization on both frontend and backend
- Validation of branch access permissions
- Prevention of unauthorized operations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:

- Bulk operations UI for multiple doctors
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Audit trail visualization
- Role-based action restrictions

### Performance Improvements:

- Virtual scrolling for large doctor lists
- Progressive loading of doctor details
- Enhanced caching strategies

## Conclusion

The frontend implementation successfully covers all three robust soft delete scenarios with a user-friendly interface that provides clear feedback and prevents user errors. The implementation maintains backward compatibility while introducing powerful new features for branch-specific doctor management.
